## 1.1 Understanding SoundCloud as a Platform for Independent Artists

We were interested in understanding how new music producers who are not signed to a label approach SoundCloud, a free and accessible platform, to gain followers and build their audience. In the evolving music industry, there are multiple pathways to becoming popular, and SoundCloud serves as a critical space where independent artists can distribute their work without traditional gatekeepers. This study aims to explore the strategies these artists use, how frequently they upload music, and whether their activity correlates with key popularity metrics such as the number of plays and followers.

Multiple articles have examined how the new music industry is changing, but few have focused specifically on SoundCloud. Studies such as Allen et al. (2021) have investigated how digital platforms influence independent musicians, while Smith (2019) explored general trends in music promotion. However, existing research has not yet examined the frequency of uploads and its impact on artist success. Prior work, such as Doe (2017), has focused on fame-building strategies through social engagement rather than upload patterns. This study fills that gap by providing an analysis of SoundCloud-specific upload behaviors.

By collecting and analyzing this data, we can contribute to a broader understanding of digital music distribution, offering insights that are valuable to both researchers studying music industry trends and artists seeking optimal strategies for audience engagement. The dataset generated through this research will help address the knowledge gap regarding independent music distribution patterns and will provide actionable intelligence for industry stakeholders, such as record labels, marketing agencies, and data-driven music platforms.

## 1.2 Data Collection Approach

To obtain data on SoundCloud music uploads, we considered multiple methods of data collection. Initially, web scraping appeared to be a viable option due to its ability to extract large amounts of unstructured data from web pages. Web scraping would have allowed us to access publicly available artist profiles and track metadata without API request limitations. However, after examining the SoundCloud website, we identified that an official API was available. 

We contacted the company and obtained permission to use the **SoundCloud for Developers API**, which grants access to all the relevant metadata in a structured format. Given the legal and ethical concerns of web scraping and the comprehensive data access provided by the API, we opted for an API-based approach.
