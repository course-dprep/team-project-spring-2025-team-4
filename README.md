## The Nostalgia Effect: How Release Year and Genre Shape IMDb Movie Ratings Over Time
This project aims to explore how nostalgia influences IMDb movie ratings by analyzing the relationship between a film’s release year and audience perception, with genre as a moderating factor. As nostalgia increasingly shapes consumer preferences, understanding its impact on movie reception can reveal biases in ratings and cultural memory effects. This study provides insights into how audiences evaluate films over time, helping industry professionals leverage nostalgia in content creation, marketing, and distribution strategies.

## Motivation
In today’s entertainment industry, maximizing audience engagement and profitability is crucial, and nostalgia has been identified as a key factor influencing movie reception (Ulker-Demirel et al., 2018). While studies have explored whether nostalgia motivates audiences to watch remakes and reunions (Tetik & Türkelı, 2023) or influences viewer engagement (Andrade, 2023), little research has examined how nostalgia manifests in IMDb user ratings and whether it directly impacts the perceived quality of a movie. From an academic perspective, this study contributes to film studies, behavioral psychology, and consumer research by empirically analyzing rating patterns over time and assessing whether nostalgia bias or selective survival bias systematically influence IMDb ratings. Additionally, it examines how factors such as genre interact with this relationship, offering an understanding of audience preferences and cultural memory in film evaluation.
From a managerial standpoint, this research has direct implications for film studios, streaming platforms, and marketers in shaping their content strategies. If older films receive higher ratings due to nostalgia rather than objective quality, this insight could influence decisions on which films to remake, re-release, or highlight in marketing campaigns. Streaming platforms can refine their recommendation algorithms by accounting for nostalgia-driven biases, improving user engagement and retention. Additionally, movie studios could leverage these findings to predict the potential success of sequels and franchise revivals, ensuring they appeal to audiences who value nostalgic elements. Understanding how genre moderates this effect also allows industry professionals to tailor their approach depending on whether certain film types (e.g., sci-fi, drama, or animation) are more influenced by nostalgia than others. Ultimately, this study provides a data-driven framework for maximizing audience appeal, optimizing content distribution, and making strategic investment decisions in the evolving film industry.

## Repository Overview 

**Include a tree diagram that illustrates the repository structure*

## Dependencies 

*Explain any tools or packages that need to be installed to run this workflow.*
The workflow requires the installation of three R packages: readr for reading .tsv files efficiently, R.utils for extracting compressed .gz files, and dplyr for data manipulation. These packages ensure seamless downloading, extraction, and processing of the IMDb datasets. If any of these packages are not installed, they can be added using install.packages().

## Running Instructions 

*Provide step-by-step instructions that have to be followed to run this workflow.*
